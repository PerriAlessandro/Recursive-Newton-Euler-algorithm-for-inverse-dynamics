# Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm for Inverse Dynamics
This repository contains code that implements the Recursive Newton-Euler algorithm for inverse dynamics.

## Description
The Inverse Dynamics Problem (IDP), also called Control Problem, consists of determining the actuation torques based on the kinematics of a body and the bodyâ€™s inertial properties (such as mass and moment of inertia). To solve this problem, we make use of the recursive N-E algorithm.

The details of the algorithm and its implementation are discussed in the Report.pdf file included in this repository.

## Usage
The code is written in MATLAB and can be executed in any MATLAB environment. The MATLAB code is provided in the Matlab_code folder.

## Author
This code has been developed by Alessandro Perri.
